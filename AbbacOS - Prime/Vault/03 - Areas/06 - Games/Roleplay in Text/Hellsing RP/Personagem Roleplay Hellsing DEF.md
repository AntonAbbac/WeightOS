### **Name: Anton Aron Abbac

**Aliase:** Silver Knight, Copier.
**Race:** Human.
**Age:** 33 years old.
### **Personality**


**Dark triad traits:** 
- Low levels of psychopathy and Medium functional narcissism.
**Pecualirity traits:** 
- Obsessive calmness, absolute control over body and mind. Desperation and Sobbing laughter in extreme situations, impulsive when pushed to extremes.
**Motivations:**
- Maintain balance between the supernatural world and the human world through research, assassinations, and third-party tasks (small organizations, monsters, and especially the Vatican).
- Hidden motivation: To absorb knowledge from other creatures and humans in order to achieve a level of power capable of taking away the free will of all humanity and taking control over everyone in the name of peace and balance.
	- Why: Since childhood, Anton has always had his own reflections and sought more knowledge, concluding that he no longer believes there is a way to maintain peace with the free will that was given to humans from the beginning of creation.

**Contradictions:**
- Human, but only in appearance and function. Anton Abbac is merely the shell that houses Blutkönig, not the other way around.
- Helping monsters, but possessing a moral code and conduct towards people and limits that he follows even while working for shady organizations.
- Voluntarily refusing to become a monster, not out of fear or apprehension, but because he still recognizes himself as one.

**Random remarks:** 
- “Hey Tyron, we're the same, there are too many people on their side. How can I be alone! Fit in? Never!!” Here the priest tries to convince an agent of the Iscariot Organization to accept death rather than become a vampire. Not because he cares, but because it would just be another problem.”
### **Appearance**

- A young man of average appearance with an athletic build. He wears white gloves with crosses drawn on the backs of his hands, dark priest clothing modified for combat and agility. Under his robes, Anton carries a cross of Saint Benedict, symbolizing his still existing faith in a cursed world.

**Stature:** 182 cm

**Hair:** Medium length with dark coloring and blonde tips.
### **Occupation**

- A night taxi driver in his spare time on the streets of London. Secretly, he is a priest of the Vatican in a secret organization called the Iscariot Organization, Section X: The Knights of God. As a Knight of God, his role is to neutralize anomalies to protect the balance between the human and supernatural worlds.
