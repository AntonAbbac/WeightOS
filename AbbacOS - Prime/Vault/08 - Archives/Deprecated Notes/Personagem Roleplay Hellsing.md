### **Abilities**

**Blutkönig** – The manifestation of Anton’s soul. Appears as a knight clad in black armor, marked with red, bloodlike crystals across its back. Carries a detonator in its right hand, enabling the Blutbombe ability. 

**Blutbombe** – Any blood touched by Anton or Blutkönig becomes a living bomb, detonated at will, with no usage limit.

**Blood Mastery** – Anton and Blutkönig can mold blood into blades, weapons, or other combat tools, turning every drop into a tactical asset.


### **Hidden Skills**

**Bayonet Mastery** — Just like Alexander Anderson can use dozens of blessed bayonets. The blessed nature of bayonets could sting vampires and deny their regeneration. He skillfully wielded the bayonets with great dexterity in close combat as swords and could also throw them with extreme precision.

**Invocation of the Sacred Blue Fire** — This fire was particularly effective against supernatural creatures as powerful as vampires and other monsters. Anton can summon this fire whenever he wishes, and his power is amplified when in possession of sacred bayonets

**Will of spirit** — Anton's desire for the good of humanity and his contradictory existential empathy, creating Blutkönig.
