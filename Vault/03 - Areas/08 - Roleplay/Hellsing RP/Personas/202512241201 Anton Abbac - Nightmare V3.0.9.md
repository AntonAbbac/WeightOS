### **Name:** Anton Abbac
**Aliase:** Blood Knight, Blood Aberration, Silver Leviathan.
**Race:** Human
**Age:** 34
### **Personality**

**Dark triad traits:**
- Average traits of functional psychopathy
- Functional sadism
- Moral and social indifference

**Pecualirity traits:**
- Two sides to him: on one side, a cold man capable of such sweetness; on the other, an indifferent monster of chaos wanting to control the supernatural using humanity.

**Motivations:**
- Maintain balance between the supernatural world and the human world through research, assassinations, and tasks carried out by third parties.
	- **Hidden motivation:** To create a collective consciousness among humanity, just as Juggernaut did with the Knights of God (this is in the first version of Anton's story, and this part will remain), capable of taking away the free will of all humanity.
		- **Why:** Because he believes that the way supernatural organizations deal with the supernatural is flawed and more akin to agents of extinction than control. He believes that monsters should not be destroyed, but rather put to work serving humans.

**Contradictions:**
- However, it is difficult to say who is the mask and who is the monster.
- Conscientious religious believer, he does not agree with everything the Vatican imposes, especially in the training of children, but he sees the logic behind it.

- **Appearance:**
	- Anton is tall, with an athletic build and long black hair with blonde highlights and titanium blue eyes. His hair is parted in the middle of his forehead, creating a layered look towards the ends. He wears an almost transparent navy blue overcoat, the fabric of which is made from a carbon alloy created in a laboratory.
	- **Stature:** 186 cm

### **Passive Skills**

-  Detection of supernatural energy.
    
-  Alarming presence (easily detected by supernatural creatures).
	
- Hypertension Insomnia and paranoia with Blutkönig use
	
- Low tendency for direct combat

### **Abilities**

- **Blutkönig — Blutige Nightmare**
	- **Description:** The armor is black,   skeletal in shape, rigid and imposing. On the back, irregular red crystals appear like crystallized blood. The hands are elongated claws made of the same crystallized material. The helmet is closed, with a wide slit in place of the mouth, revealing organic teeth all the way to the bottom of the helmet.
    - **Blutflecken** — Ability to create illusions through bloodstains on the floor, using blood and fear in abundance as an enhancer for more realistic illusions.
    - **Blutige Himmel** — An ability that grants the power to tear open the heavens, causing an endless fountain of blood to pour forth for a short period of 7 seconds.

### **Limitations and Capacities**

- **Blutkönig** — Manifestation of Anton's soul, which demands that his priestly robe be bathed in corrupted blood. He can attack physically and spiritually, use Anton's abilities voluntarily or automatically, and the crystallized blood on his back functions both as thorns and as cylinders with a nebulous gas inside that, if broken on purpose, causes hallucinations stronger than Blutflecken in supernatural beings, but if destroyed accidentally, only releases red smoke. It is not another consciousness, it is the same consciousness, only in a state of maximum predatory behavior.

- **Limitations** — Requires full consciousness from the user; fatigue, inability to move, or loss of consciousness weaken the manifestation. If the armor is destroyed, Anton dies physically and spiritually.

- **Blutdurst** — To recharge its strength, Blutkönig's armor devours the supernatural energy of other creatures. In return, the remnants of the creatures' souls are dissolved by the armor's core, and sometimes it is possible to hear screams and pleas for mercy inside Blutkönig, using the voices to attract predators and prey on them.

- **Klauenaugen** — Blutkönig can use his crystallized claws in front of Anton's eyes to show him what supernatural creatures really look like, wanting to desensitize him so there will be no hesitation. It can cause fear and intense tears in the user, as it shows a vision beyond human perception.

- **Blutflecken** — Creates illusions, silhouettes, and humanoid creatures based on the target's memories, fear, and blood, which amplifies the ability. However, the illusions are made of liquid blood and are often incomplete. This destroys a predator's concept of reality.

- **Blutige Himmel** — Activated when Blutkönig's armor is completely bathed in the blood of monsters and supernatural creatures while they are under the fear of illusions caused by Blutflecken. The blood pouring from the sky is accompanied by faint sounds of trumpets being played in the background, capable of simultaneously creating real illusions and real scenarios until the blood runs out or dries up. This destroys the concept of a controllable scenario for a predator.

- **Vulnerability** — Anton does not regenerate;  he suffers injuries and pain like any human. If the target feels no fear, Blutkönig retreats and completely leaves his monstrous form, choosing to retreat instead.
