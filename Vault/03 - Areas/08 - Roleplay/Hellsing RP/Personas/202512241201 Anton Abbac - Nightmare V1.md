### **Name:** Anton Abbac
**Aliase:** Blood Knight, Blood Aberration.
**Race:** Human
**Age:** 34
### **Personality**

**Dark triad traits:**
- Average traits of functional psychopathy
- Functional sadism
- Moral and social indifference

**Pecualirity traits:**
- Two sides to him: on one side, a cold man capable of such sweetness; on the other, an indifferent monster of chaos wanting to control the supernatural using humanity.

**Motivations:**
- Maintain balance between the supernatural world and the human world through research, assassinations, and tasks carried out by third parties.
	- **Hidden motivation:** To create a collective consciousness among humanity, just as Juggernaut did with the Knights of God (this is in the first version of Anton's story, and this part will remain), capable of taking away the free will of all humanity and taking control over everyone in the name of peace. 
		- **Why:** Because he finds the way supernatural organizations deal with the supernatural flawed and more like agents of extinction rather than control, so he saw in Juggernaut's abilities the capacity to control multiple consciousnesses... All this to keep humanity and the supernatural under control and fulfill his purpose as a Knight of God, becoming a supreme consciousness.

**Contradictions:**
- Human, but only in appearance and function. Anton Abbac is merely the shell that houses Blutkönig, not the other way around.
- He helps monsters, but he has a moral code and a code of conduct regarding people and limits that he follows, even though he works for shady organizations.
- Conscientious religious believer, he does not agree with everything the Vatican imposes, especially in the training of children, but he sees the logic behind it.

- **Appearance:**
	- Anton is tall, with an athletic build and long black hair with blonde highlights and titanium blue eyes. His hair is parted in the middle of his forehead, creating a layered look towards the ends. He wears an almost transparent navy blue overcoat, the fabric of which is made from a carbon alloy created in a laboratory or taken from the skin of ghosts.
	- **Stature:** 186 cm

### **Passive Skills**

- Supernatural alchemy (ability to create improvised elixirs and potions).
    
-  Medium skill in hand-to-hand combat.
    
-  Detection of supernatural energy.
    
-  Alarming presence (easily detected by supernatural creatures).
### **Abilities**

- **Master Abilitie:** Blutkönig — Blutige Illusion
	- **Description:** The armor is black, skeletal in shape, rigid and imposing. On the back, irregular red crystals appear like crystallized blood. A red cloak with unknown crosses covers the shoulders, and the hands are elongated claws made of the same crystallized material. The helmet is closed, with a wide crack in place of the mouth, revealing only an intense red glow. A red core pulses in the chest, visible through the armor, as if it were Anton's very essence.
    - **Blutflecken** — Ability to create illusions through bloodstains on the floor, using blood and fear in abundance as an enhancer for more realistic illusions.
    - **Blutbombe** — Ability to transform loose blood or blood from a specific target into explosive matter. Activated with a simple snap of the hand that resembles a detonation.
    - **Blutige Himmel** —  An ability that grants the power to tear open the heavens, causing an endless fountain of blood to pour forth for a short period of 7 seconds.


- **Bayonet Mastery** — Anton masters the use of bayonets in combat, capable of wounding vampires and nullifying their regeneration. He uses them with precision in close combat and also as accurate projectiles.

### **Limitations and Capacities**

- **Blutkönig** — Manifestation of Anton's soul, requiring his priestly robe to be bathed in corrupted blood, which can only be used against supernatural beings. It can attack physically and spiritually, use Anton's abilities voluntarily or automatically, and the crystallized blood on its back causes deformities and illogical behavior in supernatural beings, without killing them. It acts according to Anton's conscious and unconscious desires, seeking practical solutions; if a major goal is not possible, it pursues smaller ones.

- **Limitations** — Requires full consciousness from the user; fatigue, inability to move, or loss of consciousness weaken the manifestation. If the armor is destroyed, Anton dies physically and spiritually.

- **Blutflecken** — Creates illusions, silhouettes, and human-shaped creatures based on the target's memories, fear, and blood, which amplifies the ability. Blutbombe can be used to detonate an illusion according to the user's will.

- **Blutbombe** — Blutbombe can only be used on one target at a time, and the user must make contact with blood to activate this ability. The explosion reaches a radius of 3 meters in various directions and can be used on illusions made of blood.

- **Blutige Himmel** — Activated by staining the hands with the blood of three innocents. The blood from the sky is lethal to vampires and other supernatural beings, amplifying the deadly effects of conventional means such as silver or sunlight. Slightly amplifies other technical skills, such as Blutbombe and Blutflecken.

- **Vulnerability** — Anton does not regenerate; he suffers injuries and pain like any human.
