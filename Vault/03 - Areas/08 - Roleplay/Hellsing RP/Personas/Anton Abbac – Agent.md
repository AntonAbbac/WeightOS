**Peculiarity Traits —**

### **Appearance —**

### **Motivations —**
- Serve the British order as a disposable soldier, in a world where they try to crush you mercilessly for the slightest mistake.
	- **Hidden Motivation —**
		- Resist and influence ordinary humans not to let themselves be institutionalized into accepting the ways that secret and intelligence organizations deal with the supernatural. Waging a war where he is practically fighting alone on the front lines without any popular support.

**Contradictions —**
- It may not seem like it, but he really cares about other people, being a cold-hearted hero in fact.
- He serves secret institutions, but steals documents and exposes fraud in untraceable ways.
### **Passive Skills**

- Master of hand-to-hand combat
    
- High-level tactical strategist
    
- Human peak speed and strength
    
- Incompetence in teamwork

### **Abilities**

- **Prismaluma eyes —** Pearly pink eyes that emit light depending on where they look, capable of reflecting supernatural elements to those who look at them. To the user, both dead and living beings emit faint waves of light in their eyes.
	- **Reflection of intention —** Upon mutual eye contact, the target's eyes reflect their intention back to the user, allowing them to predict two linear movements.
	- **Direct retraction —** Depending on the color emitted by a target, their speed as perceived by the user slows down or speeds up. Can be used to anticipate movement or notice critical weaknesses in the target.


### **Limitations**

- **Critical Angle —** If the user is too tired and unable to make direct eye contact with the target for more than 1 minute, the eyes become useless and do not reflect back to the user.
- **Pre-blindness —** The user is mentally stimulated to observe only colors reflected by targets, but not by objects, actual light factors, or the absence of light. This makes it difficult for them to see like a normal human being.
