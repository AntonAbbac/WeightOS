### **Name: Anton Aron Abbac

**Aliase:** Silver Knight, Hell's helper and Echoes of Juggernaut.
**Race:** Human.
**Age:** 33 years old.
**Occupation:** He is a priest of the Vatican in a secret organization called the Iscariot Organization, Section X: The Knights of God. As a Knight of God, his role is to neutralize anomalies to protect the balance between the human and supernatural worlds.
### **Personality**

**Dark triad traits:** 
- Low levels of psychopathy and Medium functional narcissism. Megalomania as a key trait.
**Pecualirity traits:** 
- Obsessive calmness. Desperation and Sobbing laughter in extreme situations, impulsive when pushed to extremes.
**Apparent motivation:**
- Maintain balance between the supernatural world and the human world through research, assassinations, and tasks carried out by third parties (small organizations, monsters, and especially the Vatican).
	- **Hidden motivation:** Create a collective consciousness among humanity, just as Juggernaut did with the Knights of God (this is in the first version of Anton's lore, and this part will remain), capable of taking away the free will of all humanity and taking control over everyone in the name of peace and balance. Breakdown: From innocent hero to future tyrannical villain, albeit hidden.
		- **Why**: since childhood, Anton has always had loneliness as his ally, and no human warmth, so he saw in Juggernaut's abilities the capacity to control multiple consciousnesses... All this to keep humanity and the supernatural under control and fulfill his purpose as a Knight of God by becoming a supreme consciousness.

**Contradictions:**
- Human, but only in appearance and function. Anton Abbac is just the shell that houses Blutkönig, not the other way around.
- He helps monsters, but he has a moral code and a code of conduct towards people and limits that he follows, even while working for shady organizations.
- False religious belief. Practically an anti-Anderson.

### **Appearance**

- A young man of average appearance with an athletic build. He wears white gloves with crosses drawn on the backs of his hands, dark priest clothing modified for combat and agility. Under his robes, Anton carries a cross of Saint Benedict, symbolizing his still existing faith in a cursed world.

- **Stature:** 182 cm

- **Hair:** Medium length with dark coloring and blonde tips.

### **Passive Skills**

- Medium skill in hand-to-hand combat.
    
- Supernatural alchemy (ability to create improvised elixirs and potions).
    
- Detection of supernatural energy.
    

### **Abilities**

- **Master Abilitie:** Blutkönig — Blood Manipulation
	- **Description:** The manifestation of Anton's soul. It appears as black armor with a red core that reflects light and has holes marked with red crystals resembling crystallized blood on the back. It is Anton's existence in two different states, not just a cheap summoning.
    - **Blutige Himmel** - An ability that grants the power to tear open the heavens, causing an endless fountain of blood to pour forth for a short period of 7 seconds.
    - **Blutmanipulation** - Ability to shape blood into blades, weapons, or other combat tools, turning every drop into a tactical resource.

- **Bayonet Mastery** — Anton uses bayonets in combat. The blessed nature of his bayonets can wound vampires and nullify their regeneration. He wields bayonets with great skill in close combat, as if they were swords, and can also throw them with extreme accuracy.

### **Limitations and Capacities**

**Blutkönig** —
- To summon the manifestation of his soul, Anton must drench his priestly robe in corrupted blood, which means it MUST be used against supernatural beings and cannot be used against humans.
- Capable of delivering basic attacks and amplified blows that affect both physical and spectral or spiritual beings.
- Able to use all of Anton's abilities at the user's will or not, if necessary.
- The crystallized blood on Blutkönig's back is absolutely toxic to supernatural beings, causing deformities, mutations, and illogical behavior. It is not capable of causing death.

**Calamity of conscience.**
- In action, Blutkönig follows Anton's conscious and unconscious desires without restrictions or moral masks, with a strong tendency toward practical resolutions.
- Blutkönig acts according to conscience; if he cannot achieve a greater goal immediately, he pursues lesser goals. It is as if Anton's irritation and daydreams lead Blutkönig to take action toward a target so that his unconscious desire is fulfilled, even if the user does not rationally want it.

**Limitations**
- The user must be fully conscious to use it. The more unconscious the user is, the weaker the manifestation will be and the shorter the range of attacks and abilities.
- Exhaustion or inability to move with prolonged use, as well as loss of consciousness in fainting spells.
- If Blutkönig, the armor is destroyed, Anton will die physically and spiritually and disappear from existence, with no right to heaven or hell.

**Blutige Himmel** —
- To activate this ability, the user must stain their bare hands with the blood of three innocent lives, without the aid of tools or means other than their own hands.
- The blood that falls from cracks in the sky is deadly to any vampire or supernatural being who drinks it out of necessity, for it is pure in divinity and innocence. The deadly effect is not complete upon contact; it amplifies the means of mortality if not drunk, such as sunlight for vampires (actually deadly to vampires) and silver in general.
- The ability itself does not belong to Anton, but to his own divine archetype, where love takes the selfish alternative for victory.

**Blutmanipulation** —
- In normal use, Anton can only create small blades and small, sticky creatures to affect the enemy.
- With Blutige Himmel active: With no clear limitations, the domain eliminates any weakness or fatigue when using this ability. Example of use: Anton can use a pool of blood under a target with a touch to create deadly spikes made of crystallized blood that pierce the target's body.

**Unable to regenerate** —
- If Anton is injured in a confrontation, he will bleed and feel pain like any other human being, without any supernatural regeneration abilities.

**Essence** —
- Anton is a knight who represents the commandment of love and pride. (Note: this combination is more common in female knights than in male knights, making Anton's way of acting and thinking more androgynous and neutral. Without sensuality.)
