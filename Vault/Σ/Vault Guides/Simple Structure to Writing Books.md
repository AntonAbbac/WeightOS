## 🗝️ Simple Structure for Writing Books in Obsidian

Creating a narrative timeline requires juggling themes, situations, and a lot of raw ideas.  
To avoid mental clutter, it helps to separate **writing**, **structure**, and **creative assets**.

Below is a **simple, scalable folder structure** designed for long-form writing in Obsidian, fully compatible with the Longform plugin.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

(Book Name)

- 01 - Chapters → Scene index and narrative order

- 02 - Scenes → Standalone scene files

- 03 - Assets
	- Brainstorm → Short, raw, unfiltered ideas
	- Ideas → Refined and viable concepts
	- Personas → Internal character wiki
	- Index → World rules, timeline, and major milestones

---

## 📘 Folder Roles Explained

### 01 - Chapters

Acts as a **scene index**, not a writing space.

- Defines narrative order
- Groups and references scenes
- Represents editorial structure, not prose

---

### 02 - Scenes

The **core narrative units**.

- Each file represents a single scene
- Scenes are written independently
- Can be rearranged, reused, or cut without breaking structure

---

### 03 - Assets

Everything that supports the story but is not part of the final prose.

#### Brainstorm

- Raw, disposable ideas
- No filtering, no judgment
- Short notes meant to be explored or discarded

#### Ideas

- Surviving concepts from Brainstorm
- More structured and intentional
- Potential candidates for scenes, arcs, or worldbuilding

#### Personas

- Internal character wiki
- Tracks personality, motivations, and evolution
- Should link back to scenes where the character appears

#### Index

- Single source of truth for the story universe
- Includes:
	- World rules
	- Historical timeline
	- Major events and milestones

---

## 📎 Basic Tags and Properties

Use minimal metadata to track narrative state and intent.

status: draft | canon | cut

arc: character | theme

### Recommended Usage

- status
	
	- draft: incomplete or experimental
	- canon: finalized and approved
	- cut: removed but kept for reference
- arc
	
	- Identifies the narrative focus of a scene
	- Useful for filtering, queries, and revisions

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

- Scenes are **content**
- Chapters are **structure**
- Assets are **context**
- Index files define **canon**

If this system breaks, it won't be because of complexity.  
It will be because the rules were ignored.

That's on the writer.
