# 1. 🔷 Core Principle of the Vault

This vault is **not organized by topics**, but by **information state and function**.

The defining question for where a note belongs is not

> "What is this about?"

but

> "At what stage of the system is this information?"

This principle prevents:

- topic-based folder sprawl
- duplicated notes
- difficulty retrieving actionable knowledge

---

# 2. 💠 Functional Layers of the System

## 2.1 Input (capture)

### 📁 +

**Function:** fast, low-friction capture.

- Unprocessed content.
- No required structure, links, or categorization.
- Designed to minimize cognitive load at capture time.

**Operational rule:**  
Everything that enters here must be processed and moved out.

---

## 2.2 Vault Meta-control

### 📁 ∞

**Function:** document, maintain, and evolve the system itself.

Subfolders:

- **Archives**  
	Obsolete or closed material kept only for reference.
	
- **Templates**  
	Reusable note structures.  
	Standardization reduces repeated decision-making.

This folder ensures the system does not rely on memory or intuition.

---

## 2.3 Personal Domain and Temporality

### 📁 Personal

#### 📁 Areas

Ongoing responsibilities without a defined end date:

- health
- studies
- finances
- personal maintenance

They differ from projects because they are maintained, not completed.

---

#### 📁 Journal

Free notes, without chronological impatience

- 📁 **Daily:** Daily Notes
- 📊 **Calendar.base:** Overview of the days

This creates an overview of the days.

---

## 2.4 Execution and Knowledge Production

### 📁 Workspace

#### 📁 AI

**Function:** isolate AI-generated content from validated human knowledge.

Prevents mixing:

- probabilistic outputs
- unverified inferences
- ideas not yet assimilated

Subfolders:

- **Prompts:** reusable inputs
- **Resources to Fill:** incomplete content
- **System Prompts:** configurations
- **Worst Answer:** failure cases for calibration

---

#### 📁 Clippings

**Function:** store raw external material.

- Quotes
- Book excerpts
- Articles
- Imported notes

Nothing here is considered personal knowledge.  
Value only emerges after processing and linking.

---

#### 📁 Courses

**Function:** structured, temporary learning.

- Organized by course/module
- Limited lifespan
- After completion, content should:
	- be promoted to permanent knowledge
	- or archived

---

#### 📁 Projects

Anything with:

- a clear objective
- defined scope
- completion criteria

Projects connect thinking to action.

---

#### 📁 ZK PS (Zettelkasten – Systematic Problem Thinking)

The cognitive core of the system.

- **Fleeting IP**  
	Unstable ideas and transitional notes.
	
- **Literature PS**  
	Notes derived from external sources.  
	Not yet personal knowledge.
	
- **Permanent R**  
	Consolidated knowledge:
	
	- one idea per note
	- written in your own words
	- densely linked

This is where information becomes understanding.

---

## 2.5 Documentation and Index

### 📁 Σ

#### 📁 Attachments of the Vault

Binary files (PDFs, images, audio).  
Prevents conceptual folders from being polluted.

#### 📁 Vault Systems and Guides

Documentation of how the vault works:

- rules
- naming conventions
- workflows
- movement criteria

---

# 3. 🔘 Summary Operational Flow

```
Capture → +
Processing → Clippings / AI / Fleeting
Synthesis → Literature PS → Permanent R
Application → Projects / Areas
Review → Journal
```

This flow is **iterative**, not linear.

---

# 4. ⚜️ What This System Solves

- Prevents passive accumulation
- Reduces cognitive friction
- Separates input from thinking
- Enables review and reuse
- Scales without collapsing

---

# 5. 🔶 Condition for Effectiveness

This vault **requires regular processing**.  
Without it, it becomes a well-labeled storage system.

The structure is sound.  
Efficiency depends entirely on disciplined use.

If needed, the next steps could be:

- formalizing movement rules between folders
- defining objective promotion criteria for notes
- designing a minimal daily/weekly workflow
- mapping common anti-patterns in this type of vault
