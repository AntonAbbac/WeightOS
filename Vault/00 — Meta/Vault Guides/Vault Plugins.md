# 📦 Plugins

## Core Plugins

Native Obsidian plugins. They define the **baseline functionality** of the vault.

### Audio Recorder

Records audio directly inside notes.  
Useful for fast capture, interviews, or spoken thoughts when typing is inefficient.

### Backlinks

Displays notes that link to the current note.  
Essential for non-linear thinking and contextual navigation.

### Bases

Basic structured data management (simple lists and tables).  
Provides lightweight organization without external plugins.

### Bookmarks

Shortcuts to notes, searches, or sections.  
Used for fast access to critical or recurring content.

### Command Palette

Text-based command interface.  
Reduces menu dependency and accelerates frequent actions.

### Daily Notes

Captures events, thoughts, and reactions as they occur, without structure or filtering.

### Files

Vault file explorer.  
Direct control over folders and note hierarchy.

### Footnotes View

Centralized view of footnotes.  
Useful for long-form, academic, or technical writing.

### Graph View

Graph-based visualization of note connections.  
Exploration tool, not a primary organization method.

### Outgoing Links

Lists links **from** the current note.  
Complements backlinks and helps check conceptual coherence.

### Outline

Displays the heading structure of a note.  
Enables fast navigation in long notes.

### Page Preview

Previews linked notes on hover.  
Reduces context switching during reading.

### Properties View

View and edit note metadata (frontmatter).  
Foundation for automation, filtering, and Dataview.

### Quick Switcher

Fast note search by title.  
Primary navigation method in large vaults.

### Search

Global search with filters and regex.  
Core information retrieval tool.

### Slash Commands

Quick insertion of commands and blocks using `/`.  
Speeds up structured writing.

### Slides

Create presentations from Markdown notes.  
Allows content reuse without leaving Obsidian.

### Tags View

Tag-based navigation and overview.  
Complementary to links, not a replacement.

### Unique Note Creator

Creates a single, stable, base note for each concept to prevent duplication and fragmentation.

### Word Count

Word count per note or section.  
Objective writing output tracking.

### Workspaces

Save and restore interface layouts.  
Switch between different working contexts.

No functional contribution to the system.

Useful for dashboards or daily control notes.

Designed for books, theses, and extended writing workflows.

Avoids manual CSS editing.

Scales better in large vaults.

### QuickAdd

Key plugin for reducing operational friction.

### Rainbow Colored Sidebar

No functional impact.

### Scroller

Advanced scrolling control.

### Tag Wrangler

Bulk tag management.  
Prevents fragmentation and inconsistency.

### Templater

Dynamic templates with logic and variables.

Micro-optimization for writing flow.

## 💎 System-level view

Taken together, these plugins fall into **four functional groups**:

1. **Navigation and retrieval**  
	Backlinks, Search, Omnisearch, Quick Switcher, Graph View
	
2. **Structure and data**  
	Properties View, Bases, Linter, Tag Wrangler
	
3. **Writing and production**  
	Templater, Unique Note Creator, Longform, Writing Goals, Word Count
	
4. **Interface and ergonomics**  
	Workspaces, Page Preview, Outline, Style Settings

No single plugin is mandatory.  
Value emerges from **alignment with the vault workflow**, not plugin count.
