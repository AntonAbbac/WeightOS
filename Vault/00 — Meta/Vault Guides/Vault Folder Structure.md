Below is the **technical translation to English**, preserving structure, terminology, and intent. No reinterpretation, no tone shift.

---

# 1. Core Principle of the Vault

This vault is **not organized by topics**, but by **information state and function**.

The defining question for where a note belongs is not

> "What is this about?"

but

> "At what stage of the system is this information?"

This principle prevents:

- topic-based folder sprawl
- duplicated notes
- difficulty retrieving actionable knowledge

---

# 2. Functional Layers of the System

## 2.1 Input (capture)

### 📁 00 — Inbox

**Function:** fast, low-friction capture.

- Unprocessed content.
- No required structure, links, or categorization.
- Designed to minimize cognitive load at capture time.

**Operational rule:**  
Everything that enters here must be processed and moved out.

---

## 2.2 Vault Meta-control

### 📁 00 — Meta

**Function:** document, maintain, and evolve the system itself.

Subfolders:

- **Archives**  
	Obsolete or closed material kept only for reference.
	
- **Attachments**  
	Binary files (PDFs, images, audio).  
	Prevents conceptual folders from being polluted.
	
- **Templates**  
	Reusable note structures.  
	Standardization reduces repeated decision-making.
	
- **Vault Systems and Guides**  
	Documentation of how the vault works:
	
	- rules
	- naming conventions
	- workflows
	- movement criteria

This folder ensures the system does not rely on memory or intuition.

---

## 2.3 External Inputs and Auxiliary Tools

### 📁 AI

**Function:** isolate AI-generated content from validated human knowledge.

Prevents mixing:

- probabilistic outputs
- unverified inferences
- ideas not yet assimilated

Subfolders:

- **Prompts:** reusable inputs
- **Resources to Fill:** incomplete content
- **System Prompts:** configurations
- **Worst Answer:** failure cases for calibration

---

### 📁 Clippings

**Function:** store raw external material.

- Quotes
- Book excerpts
- Articles
- Imported notes

Nothing here is considered personal knowledge.  
Value only emerges after processing and linking.

---

### 📁 Courses

**Function:** structured, temporary learning.

- Organized by course/module
- Limited lifespan
- After completion, content should:
	- be promoted to permanent knowledge
	- or archived

---

## 2.4 Personal Domain and Temporality

### 📁 Personal

#### 📁 Areas

Ongoing responsibilities without a defined end date:

- health
- studies
- finances
- personal maintenance

They differ from projects because they are maintained, not completed.

---

#### 📁 Journal

Chronological logging, not conceptual storage.

- **Daily:** factual and emotional record
- **Weekly:** synthesis and pattern recognition
- **Monthly:** strategic review
- **Annual:** long-term direction

This creates abstraction layers over time.

---

## 2.5 Execution and Knowledge Production

### 📁 Workspace

#### 📁 Projects

Anything with:

- a clear objective
- defined scope
- completion criteria

Projects connect thinking to action.

---

#### 📁 ZK PS (Zettelkasten – Systematic Problem Thinking)

The cognitive core of the system.

- **Fleeting IP**  
	Unstable ideas and transitional notes.
	
- **Literature PS**  
	Notes derived from external sources.  
	Not yet personal knowledge.
	
- **Permanent R**  
	Consolidated knowledge:
	
	- one idea per note
	- written in your own words
	- densely linked

This is where information becomes understanding.

---

# 3. Summary Operational Flow

```
Capture → Inbox
Processing → Clippings / AI / Fleeting
Synthesis → Literature → Permanent
Application → Projects / Areas
Review → Journal
```

This flow is **iterative**, not linear.

---

# 4. What This System Solves

- Prevents passive accumulation
- Reduces cognitive friction
- Separates input from thinking
- Enables review and reuse
- Scales without collapsing

---

# 5. Condition for Effectiveness

This vault **requires regular processing**.  
Without it, it becomes a well-labeled storage system.

The structure is sound.  
Efficiency depends entirely on disciplined use.

If needed, the next steps could be:

- formalizing movement rules between folders
- defining objective promotion criteria for notes
- designing a minimal daily/weekly workflow
- mapping common anti-patterns in this type of vault
