# Zettelkasten System

The **Zettelkasten system** is a structured workflow for capturing ideas and transforming them into durable, interconnected knowledge. Originally developed by **Niklas Luhmann**, its primary goal is to create notes that **retain relevance over time** and actively contribute to long-term thinking, rather than being passively stored and forgotten.

The system is based on the progressive refinement of ideas through distinct note types, each serving a specific role in the knowledge lifecycle.

## 1. Fleeting Notes

**Fleeting Notes** are short-lived capture notes created to record ideas quickly and with minimal friction. Their purpose is not completeness, but **preservation of thought at the moment it occurs**.

They may later be:

- developed into Literature Notes,
- transformed into Permanent Notes,
- or discarded if they prove irrelevant.

**Fleeting Notes typically contain:**

- Initial ideas written in the author's own words
- Observations, sketches, or loosely structured thoughts
- Partial insights meant to support or extend other notes

They function as an **entry point**, not an endpoint.

## 2. Literature Notes

**Literature Notes** are created when engaging with external sources such as books, articles, papers, or videos. Their goal is not transcription, but **active interpretation**.

All content should be rewritten to ensure understanding and avoid passive copying.

**Literature Notes typically contain:**

- External ideas paraphrased in the author's own words
- Clear references to the original source
- Personal comments, questions, or critiques
- Direct quotations only when strictly necessary

These notes act as a **bridge between external information and internal knowledge**.

---

## 3. Permanent Notes

**Permanent Notes** represent the final and most important stage of the Zettelkasten workflow. They consolidate ideas into **atomic, self-contained units of knowledge** that can stand on their own and remain understandable in the future.

Each Permanent Note should express **one clear idea**, written as if it were intended for publication.

**Permanent Notes typically contain:**

- Atomic, independent content written clearly and definitively
- Explicit links to related notes, forming a knowledge network
- Ideas expressed in the author's own conceptual framework

Their value emerges from **connection**, not isolation.

---

## Core Characteristics

- Each note carries a **unique identifier**, commonly in the format `YYYYMMDDHHMM`
- Notes are intentionally **linked**, not grouped by topic
- The system is **evolutionary**, growing organically with each new note
- Notes do not need immediate utility to be valuable
- The system exists to **support the author's thinking**, not constrain it

## Final Notes

The Zettelkasten system can feel unintuitive for those seeking immediate results or rigid structure. It is not designed for quick answers, but for **long-term intellectual development**.

This document describes the foundational structure of the system and is expected to evolve over time, just like the Zettelkasten itself.
