# Zettelkasten System

The Zettelkasten system is a workflow for capturing ideas and consolidating smart notes, created by Niklas Luhmann. Its original purpose was to create notes that would not disappear over time nor become irrelevant.

## 1. Fleeting Notes

- Fleeting Notes are quick-capture notes with an initially superficial purpose, but which, depending on their relevance and the author's interest, may be transformed into original ideas, known as Permanent Notes. In short, they are temporary notes that may or may not be discarded according to their usefulness. Fleeting Notes should contain —
- Initial ideas in the author's own words.
- Sketches, observations, and loosely captured thoughts.
- They are created to support or continue a Literature Note or a Permanent Note.

## 2. Literature Notes

- Literature Notes are notes created to summarize and interpret information from books, videos, articles, and other external sources of information. An important detail is that ideas, interpretations, and questions should always be written in the author's own words. Literature Notes should contain —

- External ideas rewritten in one's own words.
- Clear reference to the original source.
- Personal comments and opinions.
- Direct quotations, when necessary and relevant.

## 3. Permanent Notes

- Permanent Notes represent the final stage of the note-taking flow, as they are responsible for consolidating the knowledge and information provided by the other two types of notes. These notes should be atomic, independent, written in a definitive form, and connected to other notes to form a knowledge network. Permanent Notes should contain —

- Atomic, independent content written clearly and definitively.
- Explicit connections to other notes through links.
- One's own ideas and/or those of others, always reinterpreted in a personal way.

## Main Characteristics

- Each note should contain a unique identifier, typically in the format YYYYMMDDHHMM.
- Notes should be connected to one another.
- The system is evolutionary: the network grows with each new note, whether the knowledge is immediately useful or exploratory.
- The system should serve the author, not the other way around.

In summary, the Zettelkasten system can be challenging and unintuitive for those who seek something more objective and immediate, rather than an open method aimed at long-term knowledge building. It is important to consider that this note can be refined with more detail — and inevitably will be.
