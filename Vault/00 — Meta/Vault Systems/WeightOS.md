# **WeightOS**

![[WeightLogo 1.png]]

![[pallet1.png]]

> **Weight builds foundation.**  
> A structured second brain for thinking, writing, and execution.

## 🔷 Overview

**Name:** WeightOS — Prime  
**Size:** ~70 MB  
**Function:** Second Brain System

WeightOS is a **modular knowledge and writing operating system** built on Obsidian.  
It is designed to scale from **daily notes** to **long-form books**, while preserving clarity, structure, and low friction.

This is not a vault you "organize".  
It is a system you **operate**.

---

## 📃 Core Systems

These systems form the conceptual backbone of the vault:

- **[[Zettelkasten System]]**  
	Atomic knowledge, idea development, and conceptual linking.
	
- **[[ZK PS System]]**  
	Structured thinking pipeline (Fleeting IP → Literature PS → Permanent R).
	
- **[[Journaling System]]**  
	Temporal reflection and review across daily to annual layers.

---

## 📑 Guides & Documentation

Everything that explains _how_ the vault works lives here:

- **[[Vault Plugins]]**
- **[[Vault Folder Structure]]**
- **[[Simple Structure to Writing Books]]**

These are reference documents.  
You read them once, then return only when refining the system.

---

## 🧲 Plugin Architecture (Summary)

The vault relies on a **curated plugin stack**, divided into:

### Core Plugins

Native Obsidian functionality for navigation, structure, and writing.

### Community Plugins

Extended capabilities for:

- automation (Unique Note, Templater)
- data querying (Bases)
- long-form writing (Longform, Writing Goals)
- interface control (Minimal, Style Settings)

> Plugins are chosen to **reduce friction**, not add features for their own sake.

(Full list remains unchanged below for reference.)

---

## 🗂️ Folder Architecture (Summary)

The vault is organized by **information state**, not topic.

- **Inbox** → capture
- **Meta** → system control
- **AI / Clippings / Courses** → external inputs
- **Personal / Journal** → life and time
- **Workspace / Projects / ZK** → execution and knowledge

You do not memorize folders.  
You follow the flow.

# 📖 Vault Usage Guide

## 1. How to Start (Recommended Order)

To use WeightOS correctly, follow this order **without skipping steps**.

### 1️⃣ Start with the Inbox

- Capture freely.
- No structure required.
- No judgment.

**Goal:** build usage habit, not organization.

---

### 2️⃣ Use Unique Note as the Entry Note

Unique Note is the **main interface** of WeightOS.

It is used to create:

- pre-structured
- base for templates
- clean and useful

> You do not manually create notes.  
> You trigger the system. The system responds.

---

### 3️⃣ Layer Templates with Templater

- Unique Note Creator creates the base note
- Templater applies:
	- logic
	- variations
	- secondary templates on top of the Unique

**Result:**  
Consistency without rigidity.

---

## 2. Mental Flow of WeightOS

You do not think in folders.  
You think in **movement**.

```
Capture → Minimal organization → Synthesis → Real use
```

Mapped internally as:

- **Capture:** Inbox, Daily Notes
- **Organization:** Clippings, AI, Fleeting
- **Synthesis:** Literature → Permanent
- **Use:** Projects, Areas, Longform (Books)

If a note is not moving forward, its cycle is incomplete.

---

## 3. Writing, Books, and Long-Form Projects

WeightOS is designed for **serious writing**.

Supported workflows include:

- books
- essays
- structured long-form projects

Key components:

- **Longform** → structure, chapters, progress
- **Novel Word Count / Writing Goals** → measurable output
- **Slides** → content reuse and presentation

> Ideas are born in the Zettelkasten.  
> Narrative and structure live in Longform.

---

## 4. Interface & Customization

Visual design is **functional**, not decorative.

- **Minimal** theme as the foundation
- Configuration via:
	- Minimal Settings
	- Style Settings
- Icons, layouts, and Workspaces reinforce context

WeightOS already has a visual identity  
and is future-proofed for a **fully custom theme**.

---

## 5. Golden Rule

> **Do not try to use everything on day one.**

Recommended progression:

1. Unique Note
2. Daily Notes
3. Inbox
4. Projects or Writing
5. Only then: deep Zettelkasten(and ZK PS) work

WeightOS is meant to **grow with the user**, not be mastered instantly.

---

## 🔭 Closing

WeightOS works when:

- notes are created automatically
- structure fades into the background
- friction is absorbed by the system

It exists to:

- improve thinking
- sustain writing
- turn ideas into finished work
