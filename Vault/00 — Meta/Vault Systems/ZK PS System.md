# 🗃️ Zettelkasten PS System

The **PS System (Problem Solver)** is a complementary methodology integrated into the traditional Zettelkasten.  
It does not replace the original system. Instead, it **extends it** by introducing a structured, problem-oriented cycle that operates in parallel with standard Zettelkasten notes.

Conceptually, the PS System merges the classical Zettelkasten workflow with a personal method focused on **problem analysis, solution exploration, and resolution synthesis**.

## 1. 🗒️ Fleeting IP (Initial Problem)

This stage introduces a **dual-purpose capture layer**.

On one side, it behaves like traditional fleeting notes: fast, unstructured, and temporary.  
On the other, it introduces **IP (Initial Problem)**, a structured way to capture problems early, before formal analysis.

An IP note represents the **starting point of a problem-solving cycle**.

Each Fleeting IP note should contain:

- A clear description of the **problem or tension**
- The **suspected cause** of the problem
- A **personal, preliminary opinion**
- Possible quick or superficial solutions (not validated)
- A short justification of **why this problem is worth solving**

These notes are intentionally incomplete and are meant to be revisited later.

## 2. ✉️ Literature PS (Possible Solution)

This stage mirrors the traditional **Literature Note**, but with a different intent.

While standard literature notes extract ideas from external sources, **PS (Possible Solution)** notes focus specifically on **external solutions to a previously defined problem**.

This creates a second layer of duality:

- **Literature Notes** → capture knowledge
- **Literature PS Notes** → capture solutions

A problem-solving cycle may **end at this stage** without requiring a Permanent note.

Each Literature PS note should include:

- Ideas or solutions from external sources, with **proper attribution**
- The **domain or context** in which the solution applies
- Personal evaluation of each solution:
	- superior
	- inferior
	- complementary
- Links to other PS notes related to similar or adjacent problems

---

## 3. 🗄️ Permanent R (Resolution)

This stage corresponds to **Permanent Notes** in the traditional Zettelkasten, but with an added semantic layer.

**R (Resolution)** represents the **conclusion of a problem-solving cycle**.

A Permanent R note is:

- atomic
- stable
- highly connected
- written entirely in the author's own words

In addition, it must include:

- Personal reflection on the problem as a whole
- A **constructed solution**, combining:
	- external input (Literature PS)
	- internal reasoning and synthesis
- Explicit links to related PS notes and past resolutions

These notes form a **network of resolved problems**, reusable across contexts.

---

## 📎 Tagging Strategy

The PS System follows the same tagging philosophy as the traditional Zettelkasten, with a small semantic extension.

Standard Zettelkasten tags:

- Fleeting
- Literature
- Permanent

PS System extensions:

- `Fleeting IP`
- `Literature PS`
- `Permanent R`

This preserves compatibility while enabling precise filtering and querying.

## 🔧 System Compatibility

The **PS System Kasten** is designed to integrate seamlessly with the original Zettelkasten.

- It does not alter the core principles
- It does not break atomicity or linking
- It can be used **alongside standard notes without conflict**

Together, both systems create a **hybrid knowledge environment** where:

- ideas grow organically
- problems are tracked intentionally
- solutions are synthesized, not just stored

This version represents the **foundational model** of the PS System.  
If needed, it can evolve further or be extracted into a standalone methodology without compromising the original vault structure.
