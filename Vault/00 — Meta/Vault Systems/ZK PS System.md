# Zettelkasten PS System

The PS system, or Problem Solver, within the Zettelkasten consists of an alternative method that I developed myself alongside the standard Zettelkasten. It is as if I merged the original system and complemented it with my own method.

## 1. Fleeting IP

- Imagine that there are two poles in this folder. One is the normal fleeting, that is, capturing quick and objective ideas and leaving them to be structured at another available moment. On the other hand, IP or Initial Problem is an acronym that means Initial Problem. It is basically the same foundation, but with different concepts and purposes. I capture a problem, take an initial hypothesis about it, and leave it to be structured later. It should contain —

- The cause of the problem.

- Personal opinion about the problem and possible quick or superficial solutions.

- Why it should be solved.

## 2. Literature PS

- As with Fleeting IP, here the same sense of duality applies. The base Literature Notes preserve the standard Zettelkasten, while PS is my complementary method. In the base Literature Notes, we take ideas from books, articles, videos, or other external sources. In my PS, or Possible Solution, which is the acronym for Possible Solution, the goal is to extract from external sources possible solutions to my problem. A cycle of notes can end here without becoming a Permanent Note or R. It should contain —

- Ideas from other people with attribution and domain of speech (quotations).

- My opinion on the possible solutions and whether they are superior, inferior, or complementary to my own.

- Links to solutions that completed or attempted to complete another problem.

## 3. Permanent R

- In the Zettelkasten, this stage consists of notes that remain as important and atomic notes. When these notes are ready, they can be connected to others, forming a network of personal ideas and new notes. The concept R, or Resolution, which means Resolution, is a perfect complement, because it was designed, just like the other two modules IP and PS, to play a central role here. Like Permanent Notes, it is created as the final note of the cycle, but with additional details. Among these details, it carries the following elements —

- It must contain personal reflection and opinion about the problem.

- The solution must be constructed intelligently, using both external intelligent input and internal reflection.

- Links to other PS notes.

## Tags

- In the common Zettelkasten system, we usually use approximately three types of tags: Fleeting, Literature, and Permanent.

- In my complementary modular system, the approach is the same, but the tag receives a small name complement according to the stage. The tags are —

- Fleeting IP

- Literature PS

- Permanent R

My complementary method, the PS System Kasten, is one of the ideas that fit well with the original method without compromising its structure or altering its core idea of building a vast knowledge system within a Vault structure (Obsidian). Both can be used together at the same time without issues, creating a clever interplay between the two worlds. This version is only a foundation for my own complementary method, and if necessary, the method can be updated or transformed into a standalone system.
