# 📅 Journaling System

This journaling system is intentionally simple.

It exists to record reality, not to analyze it.

Complexity is added only when necessary, through templates or automation.

Nothing here is mandatory except writing.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

The system is organized by time.

Each level summarizes the previous one.

- 📁 Journal  
	- 📁 Daily  
	- 📅 Calendar.base  

That's it. No hidden layers.

---

## ✨ Daily Notes

**Purpose:** capture what actually happened.

Daily notes are raw and informal.

They are not meant to be polished or structured.

You write first. You organize later, if needed.

### What Goes into a Daily Note

- Freewriting  
  Thoughts, events, reactions, fragments. No filtering.

- Personal CSS theme  
  Daily notes can use a custom visual style if desired.

- Calendar reference  
  Each daily note connects to the calendar overview.(Plugin and Base)

Nothing else is required.

If you don't know where something belongs, it goes here.

---

## 📊 Calendar.base

**Purpose:** overview, not detail.

The calendar aggregates daily notes.

It exists to answer questions like:

- What happened this week?
- Which days matter?
- Where should I look deeper?

No journaling happens here.

Only references and summaries.

---

## ⚙️ Core Rule

Daily notes record reality.

Higher levels summarize reality.

Never invert this.
