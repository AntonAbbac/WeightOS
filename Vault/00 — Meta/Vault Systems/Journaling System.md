# Journaling System

The Journaling System is a **structured temporal reflection framework**.  
It mirrors the function of a traditional diary, but in a **digital, modular, and scalable form**, optimized for analysis, review, and long-term personal alignment.

The system is intentionally simple at its core, while remaining **highly extensible** through templates, metadata, and automation.

---

## Folder Structure

The journaling system is organized by **time granularity**, creating progressive layers of abstraction:

- 📁 **Journal**
	- 📁 **00 — Daily**
	- 📁 **01 — Weekly**
	- 📁 **02 — Monthly**
	- 📁 **03 — Annual**

Each level aggregates and synthesizes the previous one.

## Daily Notes

**Purpose:** Capture reality as it happens.

Daily notes focus on **execution, observation, and immediate feedback**.

Typical components:

- Daily journaling
- Insights and spontaneous thoughts
- Light emotional check-in
- Tasks:
	- Main
	- Secondary
	- Project-related
- AAR (After Action Review)
- Habits and routines tracking
- Training reports
- Study and learning logs

Daily notes are **high-volume and low-abstraction**.

---

## Weekly Notes

**Purpose:** Synthesize execution into patterns.

Weekly notes shift from raw data to **evaluation and adjustment**.

Typical components:

- Weekly objective
- Emotional check-in
- Weekly targets
- Focus areas
- Weekly breakdown
- Obstacles and countermeasures
- Support actions
- Experiments and tests
- Reflection

Weekly notes are **review-oriented** and directional.

---

## Monthly Notes

**Purpose:** Strategic alignment and correction.

Monthly notes operate at a **higher abstraction level**, focusing on trends and intent.

Typical components:

- Monthly mission
- Emotional check-in
- Monthly targets
- Core areas
- Monthly breakdown
- Obstacles and countermeasures
- Support actions
- Experiments
- Reflection

Monthly notes connect execution to longer-term goals.

---

## Annual Notes

**Purpose:** Long-term direction and identity-level review.

Annual notes define **vision, constraints, and systemic risk**.

Typical components:

- Core mission
- Life domains
- Annual targets
- Threats and risks
- High-level mapping
- Personal codes and principles
- Experiments
- Reflection

Annual notes act as the **strategic anchor** for all other journal layers.

## System Summary

- Daily → execution and capture
- Weekly → review and adjustment
- Monthly → alignment and strategy

This journaling system transforms journaling from **expression** into **feedback, control, and growth**.
