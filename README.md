**Second Brain / Knowledge & Writing OS**

## 🌌 Overview

**WeightOS** is a structured **second brain operating system** built on **Obsidian**.  
It is designed to support:

- long-term thinking  
- atomic knowledge (Zettelkasten)  
- structured journaling  
- serious writing and books  
- low-friction daily use  

This is **not just a vault**.  
It is a system built around **information flow**, not folders or topics.
